# PTByHosts
By using the project we can pass throught ... using **hosts**, we just use right DNS, not to transpond data to some vps in US or other regions.

1.Add the rules to your local hosts file in `hosts`.

2.Run the command in command prompt.

> ipconfig /flushdns

3.visit [Google](https://www.google.com.hk) with `https` to make sure it available.

> If you want to see videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com), you have to install DNScrypt(some ISPs don not support).

For better understanding this method please see [乱炖 – 研究WEB](http://levi.yii.so/hosts)
